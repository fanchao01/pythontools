## PythonTools -  a tool collection of functions class modules packages implemented in Python.


### For what?
I created this repository for learning Python and collecting the programs together.
For another reason, I could reuse them im my ordinary programming.
At last, I can not agree more with a said "you should have you own codes" , authough they are so 'samll'.


### System Required

* Python 2.7.x is recommended (actually written by 2.7.2+).
* Most of them are supported by Python 3.0+, but I do not granrantee.


### How to use
Download the xx.py file you want, and execute:
    python xx.py
will run the testcase within it if existed. Or import:
    import xx
    from xx import yy
to use the functions classes modules you need.


### You Should Know
These codes may contain some bugs. 
Report or fix them will receive my grave thanks :)
